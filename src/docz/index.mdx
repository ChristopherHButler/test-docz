## Initial setup

1. Install using:

```sh
npm install docz --dev
```

2. Add the following script to package.json:

```sh
"scripts": {
    "docz:dev": "docz dev",
    "docz:build": "docz build",
    "docz:serve": "docz build && docz serve",
    ...
  },

```

3. Add a ```doczrc.js``` config file to the root of your project: 

```js
export default {
  typescript: true
}
```

link to github issue:
[https://github.com/doczjs/docz/issues/847](https://github.com/doczjs/docz/issues/847)


Then everything magically works.

4. use the following npm script to start the docz dev server: 

```
npm run docz:dev
```

## Writing documentation

Check out the [mdx getting started page](https://mdxjs.com/getting-started)

 - Documentation files can go anywhere and have a ```.mdx``` extension
 - By default the basic properties every document may have are: ```name```, ```menu```, and ```route```.
   - name: The component’s page title
   - menu: If you assign the same menu string to multiple files they will be grouped on the sidebar.
   - route: If provided, route sets an URL other than the default-dashed-representation of the component’s filepath.

## Built-in components

Docz provides two basic components that help you write your docs. You have to import them on your files to be able to use them.

```
import { Playground, PropsTable } from "docz";
```

```
<PropsTable />
```

helps you explain how to use your component using its PropTypes. If you specified them in your component like this:

```jsx
Button.propTypes = {
  /**
   * Sets the button as inverted
   */
  inverted: PropTypes.bool
};

Button.defaultProps = {
  inverted: false
};
```

Using ```<PropsTable of={Button} />```  will render a nice table of the component’s props: name, type, the default value and description.
